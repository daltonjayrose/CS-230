#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room, creators of the Android game Draw It or Lose It, wanted to develop a web-based version of the game that supported multiple platforms.

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
During the creation of this design document, it was necessary to consider a wide variety of factors (operating platform, systems architecture, storage/memory management, networking, security) before coming up with the final design document. Overall, I think I did a good job of considering all of the possibilities to find an effective solution. 

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When developing the code for this project, laying out the requirements for the project was very helpful. By listing these requirements concisely in a list, it made it easier to plan for needed functionality.

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
As the design document considered a wide variety of factors, I had to learn about a lot of subjects throughout the project. If I had more time to learn and gain experience with those subjects, I think I could have made more detailed recommendations to the client.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
For this design document, the user's needs were thankfully communicated very clearly. If they had been communicated less clearly, I likely would have had to meet with the clients to get clarification about their needs. When designing software, it's important to consider the user's needs because your software is setting out to provide a solution to a problem but it's impossible to do that if you don't fully understand the difficulties of the problem. The user is likely much more knowledgable about what functionality they need than you are. By understanding their needs, you can focus on the right things and develop better software.

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In this project, I was fortunate enough that part of the software was already developed. I think one of the biggest challenges when beginning a project can be determing the direction of the project so it helps when you have a vision to start with. One thing I would make sure to do in the future when designing a similar software application is to create a detailed list of the project requirements. Additionally, creating a design document similar to the one created for this course could be helpful in determining what the final product should look like and how it should work before you begin development.
